title: It's almost Hack Reactor time
---
After dropping out of a hydro-geochemistry PhD program in 2013, I decided to become a software engineer. Just to make sure I wanted to make this transition,
I worked on a series of classes designed to help students "design their lives" and / or college education (no joke! I was on the teaching team for [this class](http://www.fastcompany.com/3044043/most-creative-people/stanfords-most-popular-class-isnt-computer-science-its-something-much-m)). At the end of that appointment,
it was still quite clear to me: while I love teaching, and I love science, I still had this burning desire to spend copious hours on the
internet and build things. Turns out these are two great characteristics of a burgeoning web developer.

I will be starting Hack Reactor on 17 August, and I am both excited and slightly queasy. One of Hack Reactor's many suggestions is that we
start a blog, and so here it is. In my blog I will explore what it means to transition from an academia-bound career to a software engineering
career, why I decided to do so, and what tools and methods I am using and learning along the way.

Why did I chose Hack Reactor? In the 1.5 years between my attempt at a PhD and starting at Hack Reactor, I had plenty
of time to research bootcamps. I chose Hack Reactor because it has one of the best track records in terms of student graduation, job
acquisition, and starting salary (with App Academy being somewhat comparable, although far less visible, and I would rather focus on
JavaScript than Ruby). Similarly, I liked how the **only** thing Hack Reactor assessed me on was how I did on my technical interview. It is a clear, consistent, and fairly objective way to build a cohort, and I have really enjoyed getting to know my cohort mates thus far.
For the record, I had to come back for a second interview, but was given the "you are *so close*, please come back in two weeks" soft rejection the
first time around. And it turns out, a number of my now fellow cohort mates also had to come back for a second interview, given a window of
time ranging from two weeks to three months. It's also great that we talk about this, too - everyone I've met so far (nearly a quarter of
the new cohorts 32 and 33) are all extremely nice, smart, motivated, and (most importantly), collaborative.

To prepare for my Hack Reactor interview, I talked to a number of former Hack Reactor students, in addition to studying the first 5 chapters of Eloquent JavaScript (a text that Hack Reactor swears by, but truthfully a little difficult to get through at times). I also prepared by doing most of the easy problems on Coderbyte, quite a few problems on Codewars, and it helped that I had some experience with numerical modeling in graduate school (but I should note that there are some people in my cohort who had zero coding background before studying for the Hack Reactor interview).

If you are considering learning how to code, or are looking to apply to some bootcamps, I hope you'll find some of these
resources helpful in preparing for interviews and getting your feet wet:

[Coderbyte.com](http://www.coderbyte.com/) (in particular the easy problems),

[Codewars.com](http://www.codewars.com/) (note: with both Codewars and Coderbyte, reviewing other users solutions is invaluable; it exposed me to more best practices and clever solutions than I would have discovered on my own),

[Projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net/) (not critical, but a whole lot of fun if you are a math and algorithm nerd like me),

[Eleoquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (Chapters 1-6, but focus on chapter 5),

and if you happen to be a woman, both [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/san-francisco) and [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) are two excellent organizations that host a number of study groups, talks, and even newbie-friendly hackathons.

More soon!
